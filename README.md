# Homepage

**Hi, there!**

My very own personal website. Basically this is just a résumé.
Simply static page, that is hosted on [**GitHub Pages**](https://pages.github.com/).  
I used [**Bootstrap 4**](https://getbootstrap.com/) to mark up `<body>`.  
As a font , I decided to take [**Open Sans**](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Open+Sans).  
And these awesome glyph icons I took from [**Font Awesome**](https://fontawesome.com/).  
If you have any suqqestions how to make it better - feel free to contact me.

Hope, you will like it!
